@  USAGES


1. Patching a BRSAR file (with "choosing"):
     btrwiibrstmbrsarpatch <brsarPatchFile> -b <brsarFile>

NOTE: <brsarPatchFile> is the BRSAR patch file (a file that ends with the .BPTH file extension).
If <brsarPatchFile> is empty (not specified), the default patch file will be used (it is normally
called "DEFAULT.BPTH").



2. Patching a BRSAR file (without "choosing" [i.e. DIRECTLY]):
     btrwiibrstmbrsarpatch <brsarPatchFile> -b <brsarFile> -d "<entryNumber> <brstmFile>"

NOTE: <entryNumber> is the number of a BRSTM track (in the patch file) you wish to patch to the BRSAR. If you don't
wish to have warnings before doing the patch, you can use the -q option to supress the warnings, although it's not recommended.
To find out the number of BRSTM tracks, you'll need to print out the info of the patch file.



3. Printing out the infos of a BRSAR patch file:
     btrwiibrstmbrsarpatch <brsarPatchFile> -i

NOTE: You can also print out the infos into a seperate TXT (text) file, using the -f option:

            btrwiibrstmbrsarpatch <brsarPatchFile> -i -f
         OR
            btrwiibrstmbrsarpatch <brsarPatchFile> -i -f <OutputTXTFile>

<OutputTXTFile> is the output file name of the text file.
If the file already exists, its contents will be destroyed.

       BRSAR PATCH FILE SYNTAX/FORMAT

¸,ø¤°`°¤ø,¸¸,ø¤°`°¤ø,¸,ø¤°`°¤ø,¸,ø¤°`°¤ø,¸,ø¤


You can easily create your own BRSAR patch file
to modify any other BRSAR file in any other Wii Game.

Just create a new text document (make sure to rename
the file extension from .txt to .bpth).
Open it up with Notepad or any other text editor.

The syntax of the BRSAR patch file goes as it follows.
Type this into the text editor:

-------------------------------------

Better Wii BRSTM BRSAR Patcher File:
<gameName>
<patchFileAuthorName>
<patchFileAuthorContactInfo>

-------------------------------------

NOTE: Do not include the dashes (-).

The text, "Better Wii BRSTM BRSAR Patcher File:", is
not case sensitive.

<gameName> is the Wii Game Name. It is required and cannot be null/empty or whitespace characters.
For newline characters there, please use \n (not \N) for that, do not directly put newline characters (by
pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard) or issues will occur.

<patchFileAuthorName> is the Author of the BRSAR patch file. It is optional, and can be whitespace characters (but
not null/empty). For newline characters there, please use \n (not \N) for that, do not directly put newline characters (by
pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard) or issues will occur.

<patchFileAuthorContactInfo> is the Author's Contact Information. It is optional, and can be whitespace characters (but
not null/empty). For newline characters there, please use \n (not \N) for that, do not directly put newline characters (by
pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard) or issues will occur.



After typing that in the text editor.
Type this in, FOR EACH BRSTM:

-------------------------------

<brsarOffset> <brstmName>
<brstmDescription>

-------------------------------

NOTE: Do not include the dashes (-).

<brsarOffset> is the offset of the entry of the BRSTM in the BRSAR,
a hexadecimal offset (starting with 0x) or decimal offset.
It is required.

<brstmName> is the BRSTM file name (and yes, including the file extension, too).
It is required and cannot be null/empty or whitespace characters. And it cannot contain
newlines, too (even by using \n).

<brstmDescription> is the description of the BRSTM file.
This is usually used to describe the music/theme/etc. of the BRSTM file.
It is optional, and can be whitespace characters (but not null/empty). For
newline characters there, please use \n (not \N) for that, do not directly put
newline characters (by pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard) or issues will occur.
